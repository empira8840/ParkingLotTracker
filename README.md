# ParkingLotTracker
Parking lot Tracker using AWS arquitecture

Companies are often wondering how to figure out how many parking spots are being taken up in their parking lots to better optimize the efficiency of their clients. One of the most common hassles with dealing with parking lots is knowing how many spots are available and how many are taken. As a company, you would also want to be able to track and keep up with how full parking lots can become from people visiting your facilities.
In this project, we designed and deployed an object recognition computer vision model with convolutional Neural network architecture using a multitude of Amazon Web Services(AWS) and an AWS DeepLens camera to keep track of cars in a parking lot. We accomplished this by setting up a deep learning model that detects and recognizes objects in a parking lot through the DeepLens camera. The model is run on an AWS Lambda function written on python which takes a snapshot through the camera every 30 seconds and imports the photo into an S3 bucket. The image is then uploaded from the S3 bucket into AWS Rekognition for analysis while also being sent to DynamoDB which sends a log with the primary key as date-time. The modified response given by the Lambda function sends an email and an SMS with the number of cars detected from the parking lot and provides information on how many spots are available and taken.
